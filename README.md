# Journey to Development!

This repository is a working copy of practical code examples that I have been creating on my journey from Technical Support over to the Development side of things. Largely, these snippets are going to be general programming techniques and practices.

Most likely, there will be more content within this repo's corresponding [Wiki](https://github.com/aussio/Journey-to-Dev/wiki), as I will be keeping my working notes there.

If you have any questions over the content here or would like to make a suggestion of content that I should look into, definitely feel free to reach out to me and let me know! If your questions aren't something that I know how to answer, that conveniently coincides perfectly with my journey towards learning more and we can learn about that subject together!
