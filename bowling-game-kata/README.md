## Bowling Game Kata
This folder contains the class and test code from going through Uncle Bob Martin's Bowling Game Kata.

The Bowling Game Kata is an object-oriented programming practice problem. It focuses on the iterative design of a class intended to score a game of bowling. There are a couple of guidelines given for how the class is expected to function, then the powerpoint below walks you through slowing creating the class using TDD and intentionally focusing on small, simple, iterative progress.
